**EECS 6895 Graph analytics using Deep Learning (Group C8)**

**Members**: Sarang Karpate (sjk2218), Gabriel Ryan (gr2547)

Repository contains the following Notebooks:

1) **Experiment 1 (Milestone 1)**: Notebook to generate sample graphs and optimize a minimization function

2) **Milestone 2**: Notebook implementing a computational graph query (CGQ) for weight allocation to nodes based on risks

3) **Milestone 3**: Notebook implementing a CGQ using Tensorflow to detect fraudulent graph structures. The system learns a parameter inherent to the network to detect fraudulence.

4) **Top Results (Final Project)**: Notebook that fetches a list of Physicians from the converted Physicians graph dataset and outputs a list of top physicians. Example run on Manhattan, Stamford and San Francisco.

5) **Clustering (Final Project)**: Notebook that implements a clustering algorithm on the graph dataset to cluster physicians in a city based on collobaration.
